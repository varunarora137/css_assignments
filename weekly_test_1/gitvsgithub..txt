It's like a time machine for code, allowing us to go back to any point in its history and see or undo changes.

Git makes it easy for multiple people to collaborate on coding projects by keeping track of who did what and when, 
and it helps avoid chaos when many people are working on the same project.

Developers work on their local repositories and can synchronize changes with a remote repository.

Command Line Tool:

typing text commands into a terminal or command prompt.

git status: It Shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.
git push: It Uploads local changes to a remote repository.typing text commands into a terminal or command prompt.
